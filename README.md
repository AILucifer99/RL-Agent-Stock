# RL-Agent-Stock
An end to end implementation of a reinforcement learning algorithm for trading stocks using real time. The model is using data from the Yahoo Finance API.

# The Advanced LSTM ipynb file is demonstating the solution using traditional concepts of Deep Learning.
Class Wise approach of creating the LSTM Network. Two types of architectures are provided
1.   The Stacked LSTM Network
2.   Compound LSTM Network

# Reinforcement Learning ipynb file is the demonstation of the RL-Agent Algorithm
The RL Agent is consists of a Compound Artificial Neural Network, with multiple hidden layers and other advanced regularizations.
1.   BatchNormalization
2.   LeakyReLU Activation
3.   Dropout Regularization
